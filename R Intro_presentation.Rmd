## What is R?
- Open-source statistical software  
- Computational environment and programming language  
- Tool for statistical analysis and data visualization  


## SPSS vs R
- SPSS:  
Easy to use (point-and-click)   
Basic graphics   
Limited statitiscal procedures   
Inflexible programming   

- R:  
More difficult to use (syntax-based)   
Professional graphics    
Unlimited statistical procedures   
Flexible programming  


## Getting and instaling R and RStudio
R and RStudio are available for free download:  
1. Download R: http://cran.r-project.org/    
2. Download RStudio: http://www.rstudio.org/    

R and RStudio are compatible with the main OS's:  
- PC  
- MAC  
- Linux


## R environment
```{r, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("G:/My Drive/FPCEUP/R trainning/GitRepo/R crash course/R crash course-Figures/r.png")
```


## R basic features
The R basic installation includes a set of resources that allows:  
- Creating different types of data structures  
- Editing and managing data structures  
- Analyzing data  
- Data visualization
  
  
  
*R base functionalities can easily be expanded through the installation of packages developed by a large, dynamic community of contributors. These packages are available for free download on [CRAN](https://www.r-project.org/).* 


## Reasons for using RStudio:
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes R's use much easier:  

* Makes it easier to write scripts (code completion)  
* Provides integrated support for editing and executing R code  
* Gives access to several functionalities through graphical interface (e.g., set work directory)  
* Allows creating and sharing R projects   
* Makes graphics and other outputs much more accessible  
* Includes a notebook interface (RMarkdown) to produce high-quality documents, reports, presentations, and dashboards  
* [and much more...](https://www.r-bloggers.com/top-6-reasons-you-need-to-be-using-rstudio/)


## The RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
```{r, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("G:/My Drive/FPCEUP/R trainning/GitRepo/R crash course/R crash course-Figures/rstudio.png")

```

# R basic functioning

## R functions
- Most functionalities are provided through built-in and user-created **functions**  
- A function is a set of statements combined to perform a specific task  
- An R-function has the following general structure:      
        - **new.object <- function.name (arg1, arg2, ...)**  
        - **A function may take different arguments or inputs (arg1, arg2, ...)**  
        - **A function's value or output can be assigned to a new object**   
              
- Basic, built-in functions are available by default in R basic installation  
- Other functions are provided by user-built packages  

```{r}
print("Hello!")
```
*"Run" in Rstudio ou "ctrl + enter" to execute the code*


## R Work session
How exactly will this work?  
- Every time we open R a new work section starts  
- R requires a working directory (WD) to store the files produced during a session  

**How to set and manage the WD?**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
getwd() # get current WD
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/tiago/Desktop") # set a new WD
```

# Operators and objects

## Basic communication with R
- The ability to assign different types of data to values to form objects is one of the R's central features   
- These objects can be analyzed and manipulated   

    - An object is formed by any type of data that can be assigned to a value  
    - The assignment operator ("**<-**") is used to create objects   
    - Objects are stored in the computer memmory during the R section  

*Comments can be added using "#"*

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x1 <- 10 # assigns number 10 to object "x1"
x1 # display object in the console
```

    
## Operators - assignment

R can work with many different types of objects  
  - From a simple scalar to complex lists of data structures

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x2 <- 0:10  # assigns integers from 0 to 20 to object "x2"
x2

x3 <- c(5, 4, 1, 6, 7, 2, 2, 3, 2, 8)  # using concatenate to create a numeric vector 
x3
```


## Basic communication with R

The interaction with R is made through syntax  
- R syntax includes several other operators besides the "*assignment*",  
    
  - Types of basic operators:  
  
> **Arithmetic** (+, -, *)    
> **Relational** (<, >, ==)  
> **Logical** (&, !, |)  

*these operators are in fact very simple functions that require a short number of arguments to work*

## Arithmetic operators
```{r, echo = TRUE}
x1 <- 2 + 2 #	addition
x2 <- 6 - 2 #	subtraction
x3 <- x1 * x2 #	multiplication
x4 <- x3 /	8 # division
x5 <- x2^x4 # exponentiation; OR 6**2
print(c(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5))
```

## Relational operators - testing (in)equality
```{r, echo = TRUE}
x1 < 5 # smaller than 
x1 <= x5 # smaller or equal than
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x1 >= x2 # larger or equal than
x1 == x5	# exactly equal to
x1 != x5 # not equal to
```

## Logical operators - boolean operations
```{r, echo = TRUE}
x1 | x3 == 4 #	x1 OR x3
x1 & x3 <= 16	# x1 AND x3
```

- Help on operators
```{r, eval= F, echo=T}  
?base::Arithmetic

?base::Logic 
```

## Managing R session

### Removing objects from the environment
```{r, echo = TRUE}
ls()  #  returns the names of the objects in the environment

rm(x1)  # removes "x1" from the environment
rm(list = ls())  # using ls() as the argument for "list" will 
                 # remove all objects from the environment
```

### Cleaning the console
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
cat("\014") # cleans console 
# OR 
shell("cls") # shell("clear") if Linux or Mac.
# OR shortcut Ctrl + l
```

## Help
### There are many ways to access R help

```{r, eval= F}
help.start() # general help

help("rm") # help on the function "rm" (quotation marks are optional) | OR ?rm

help.search("ls") # searches the help system using the keyword "ls" | OR ??ls
```

### R help files include:  
- Information about functions' general purpose, arguments, and values  
- Further details about how the a function's works     
- Examples of a function's use     

# Practice time 1: "Playing Râ€™s lottery"

# Data Structures

## Data Structures

- We usually associate the concept of data structure to a table with several rows and columns 
   
```{r, include = FALSE}
id <- c(1:5)
sex <- c("Male", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Female")
t0_date <- as.Date(c('2017-11-2','2017-11-4','2017-11-5','2017-11-10','2017-11-11'))
t0_beh_prob <- c(11, 14, 5, 20, 16)
intervention <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
t1_date <- as.Date(c('2018-11-1','2018-11-3','2018-11-4','2018-11-10','2018-11-11'))
t1_beh_prob <- c(8, 11, 7, 15, 16)

data_beh <- data.frame(id, sex, t0_date, t0_beh_prob, intervention, t1_date, t1_beh_prob)

# install.packages("kableExtra")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(data_beh, format = "markdown")
```
*rows represent observations and columns the variables*  

## Data Structures
### R has 5 general types of data structures:  
- **Vectors**  
- **Matrices**  
- Array (multidimensional matrices)  
- **Data-frames**  
- List (can contain de vectors, matrices, data-frames, and lists..)  

*These structures differ in the type of data they can store, complexity, how they are created, and way of indexing*   


## Data classes 
R can manage different types or classes of data:    
- Numeric data (integer or decimal ou decimais)   
- Logical data (True or False)  
- Character data (strings)   

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
a <- "one" # Creates a character vector
b <- 1 # Creates a numeric vector
c <- 1L # Creates a numeric (integer) vector
d <- TRUE # Creates a logical vector

# Prints objects and their classes
print(c(a, class(a)))
print(c(b, class(b)))
print(c(c, class(c)))
print(c(d, class(d)))
```

*some data structures (vectors and matrices) can only hold a single type of data, while others (data-frames and lists) can store different types*


## Data Structures - Vectors
- One-dimensional arrays that can hold **numeric**, **character**, or **logical** data 

- Use the combine or concatenate function, **c()**, to create vectors  
```{r, echo = TRUE}
id <- c(1.2, 3.1, 2.1, 4.5) # numerical vector
id
age <-  c(20, 24, 21, 40) # numerical vector
class(age) # returns object class
```

## Data Structures - Vectors (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
name <- c("Ana", "Manuel", "Afonso", "Maria") # character vector
name
class(name)
length(name) # returns object lenght
```

## Data Structures - Vectors (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
ruser <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) # logical vector
ruser
class(ruser)
table(ruser)
```

## Data Structures - Vectors (cont.)
- we can access the elements of a vector through their index 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
rbaseskills <- c(40, 35, 20, 60) # previous skills in R using a scale from 1 to 100
rmotivation <- c(60, 90, 10, 50) # motivation in a scale from 1 to 100
```

- each vector's element was its own index, allowing the identification
```{r, echo = TRUE}
rbaseskills[2] # returns vector's 2nd value
rbaseskills[c(2,3)] # returns vector's 2nd and 3rd values
```

## Data Structures - Vectors (cont.)  
- Basic operations with vectors
```{r, echo = TRUE}
rbaseskills > rmotivation # logical operation
rbaseskills + 1 # arithmetic operation
rbaseskills + rmotivation # arithmetic operation
```


## Data Structures - Matrices
- Two-dimensional array **containing elements of same mode** (numeric, character, or logical)  
  - similar to a vector, but with two dimensions (row, column)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
dailyuse <- rnorm(20, mean = 2, sd = .5) # Creates a vector with 20 elements
dailyuse <- round(dailyuse, 0) # rounds the vector to 0 decimals
dailyuse
class(dailyuse)
```

## Data Structures - Matrices (cont.)
- We can use the **matrix()** function to create a matrix  
```{r, echo = TRUE}
dailyuse <- matrix(dailyuse,  nrow = 4, ncol = 5, dimnames = list(NULL, 
                              c("day1", "day2", "day3", "day4", "day5")))
dailyuse
class(dailyuse)
```

## Data Structures - Matrices (cont.)
- to access data in a matrix we need to identify, first, the row(s) and, second, the column(s) where data is located
```{r}
dailyuse[1, 2]  # select element in row 1, column 2
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dailyuse[c(1, 4), ] # leaving column field blank will select all columns
```

```{r}
dailyuse[2:3, -1] # select rows from 2 to 3 and all columns except column 1
```


## Data Structures - Data frame
- A data frame is a special kind of matrix 
  - Allows to store different types of data in different columns  
  - Similar to the type of data structure used in most popular statistical packages (e.g., spss)  
  
- Use the **data.frame()** to create a data frame 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
df  <-  data.frame(id, name, ruser, rbaseskills, rmotivation, dailyuse) 
df
```

## Data Structures - Data frame (cont.)
- R makes easy to import data from a variety of sources (see [R Data Import/Export manual](http://mng.bz/urwn))
- A handy way for importing data to R is through text files (e.g., ".txt" or ".csv")  
```{r}
bechdel <-
  read.table(
    "G:\\My Drive\\FPCEUP\\R trainning\\GitRepo\\Intro to R\\R_intro_data\\bechdel.csv",
    header = TRUE,
    sep = ";",
    quote = "\"", 
    dec = ".",
    na.strings = " ",
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
    colClasses =  c("numeric", "character", "factor", "factor", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"),
    fileEncoding="UTF-8-BOM")
```

## Data Structures - Data frame (cont.)
- Instead of the generic function, **read.table()**, we can simply use the **read.csv2()** function
```{r}
bechdel <-
  read.csv2(
    "G:\\My Drive\\FPCEUP\\R trainning\\GitRepo\\Intro to R\\R_intro_data\\bechdel.csv")
dim(bechdel)
head(bechdel, 2)
```

## Data Structures - Data frame (cont.)
- R has also many built-in data sets  
  - Use **data()** for an overview  
  
- Lets check the mtcars data frame  
  
*The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 features of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models)*

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data() # lists all available datasets
browseURL("http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html") 
# informations about available datasets
?mtcars # diplays information about cars dataset
```


## Data Structures - Data frame (cont.)
### Loading mtcars data frame
```{r}
data(mtcars)  # loading a data frame
class(mtcars)
head(mtcars, 2)
```

## Data Structures - Data frame (cont.)
### We can use a matrix-like indexing to access values in the data frame

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars # displays a dataset
head(mtcars,2)
mtcars[1:3, 1]
```

Other way to select data in a data frame is by using the dollar sign
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars$mpg # extract column "mpg"
```

```{r}
mtcars[sample(1:nrow(mtcars), 2), ]
```


## Data Structures - Data frame (cont.) 

- Taking indexing a bit further, we can use logical operators to select elements that respect a condition

```{r}
mtcars$hp <= 70
mtcars[mtcars$hp <= 70,]
```

```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$hp <= 70 & mtcars$mpg <= 30, "qsec"]
```


# Built-in functions for basic statistics

## Basic functions - Inspect data structure
- Lets use mtcars to apply some R basic functions   
```{r, echo = TRUE}
class(mtcars) # reports the data format
dim(mtcars) # reports data dimensions
names(mtcars) # view variable names
```

## Basic functions - Inspect data structure (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
str(mtcars) # summarizes data structure
```

## Basic functions - View data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(mtcars) # returns first observations
```

## Basic functions - Summarize data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
summary(mtcars[,1:8]) # summarize R objects
```

## Basic functions - Ordering data
```{r, eval=FALSE}
which.max(mtcars$qsec) # Prints the row name (index) with the highest value for qsec
which.min(mtcars$qsec) # Prints the row name (index) with the lowest value for qsec
```

```{r}
mtcars[which.min(mtcars$qsec),] 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
order(mtcars$qsec) # Orders the vector of indexes into ascending or descending order
```

```{r}
head(mtcars[order(mtcars$qsec), ], 2) # Orders the original DF using ordered indexes
```

## Basic functions - Visualising data (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
barplot(table(mtcars$cyl)) # bar plot for cylinder
```

## Basic functions - Visualising data (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
hist(mtcars$qsec) # histogram for 1/4 mile time
```

## Basic functions - Visualising data (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
plot(mtcars$qsec, mtcars$hp) # scatter plot for hp and qsec
```

## Basic functions - Summarize variables
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(mtcars$hp)
sd(mtcars$hp)
cor(mtcars[,c(4,6,7)])
```


## R formulas
- Special class of object
- Used to specify statistical models  
```{r, echo = TRUE}
form <- y ~ x
class(form)
```

The tilde operator (**~**) tells R that the code should be treated as a formula       
- Dependent (response) variable at tilde's left-hand side    
- Predictors at tilde's right-hand side   
- Different predictors can be included using the plus sign (**+**)    
  
*other elements can be used to modify the formula*   

## R formulas (cont.)
- y as a function of x:  y ~ x  
- y as a function of x and z: y ~ x + z    
- y as a function of x, z and the interactions xz: y ~ x*z   

```{r, echo = TRUE}
names(mtcars)
model1 <- lm(qsec ~ hp, data = mtcars) # linear regression model
```

## R formulas (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
summary(model1)
```

## R formulas (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
plot(qsec ~ hp, data = mtcars)
```

## R formulas (cont.)
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA) - compares means across levels of a factor or categorical variable  

- Factors are special classes of variables in R

- The function *as.factor()* can be used to create factors. This function gives two attributes a data vector:
  1. A set of values from 1 to K, in which k is the number of different levels  
  2. The labels for each factor level

```{r}
mtcars$cyl_factor <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl) # Creates a factor from cyl
head(mtcars$cyl_factor)
```

## R formulas (cont.)

- Analysis of variance (ANOVA) can be performed by the **oav()** function

```{r, echo = TRUE}
model2 <- aov(mpg ~ cyl_factor, data=mtcars)  
summary(model2)
```
- F-test is the omnibus test of the differences between the groups' means  
```{r, echo = TRUE}
model2$coefficients # 2 cylinders is the reference category
```


## R formulas (cont.)
- Post-hoc comparisons - which specific groupsâ€™s means are different?
```{r, echo = TRUE}
TukeyHSD(model2) 
```

## R formulas (cont.)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
plot(mpg ~ as.factor(cyl), data=mtcars)
```
